        <p>Revolutionizing medical bill transparency. Empowering patients with <span class="highlight">clarity</span>, <span class="highlight">privacy</span>, and <span class="highlight">justice</span>.</p>
        <p>Our mission is to give individuals the tools they need to understand, compare, and challenge healthcare costs through anonymous sharing and AI-driven insights.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="notes">
        <p>We can all agree that our healthcare system sucks, and it shouldn't be as expensive as it is.</p>
        <p>Healthcare and paying for it can be very complicated. It requires knowledge in anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, biochemistry, psychology, sociology... there is no "expert" for everything. It is a subject that not even the experts fully understand.</p>
        <p>Physicians and other healthcare providers, unfortunately, want to be paid for their services. They have to pay for their education, their staff, their equipment, their facilities, their malpractice insurance... the list goes on. Money always plays a role in healthcare services. There is no free lunch, regardless of what propaganda you may have heard.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Payer models</span> are how we pay for healthcare. Some systems are funded by taxes (everyone pays into a single pool), while others are run by private insurance companies (where people pay premiums each month). Each system has good and bad sides. There is no perfect system. There is no utopia. We all just want our health, and our freedom</p>
        <p>Insurance companies and healthcare providers make agreements about costs, creating networks and pricing tiers. The contracts are not public, and the prices are not transparent.</p>
        <p>Two people with the same health conditions needing the same treatments might receive different bills. The final bill can depend on factors like your insurance rules, agreements between insurance companies and hospitals, the location of the service, the provider's mood, barometric pressure, and even the phase of the moon or if Venus is in retrograde with Jupiter for all we know. We, as patients, don't have any way of knowing that information. A hospital is not like a McDonald's where all their services and prices are listed. Payer systems, providers, clearinghouses, and other intermediaries all have their own secret prices and codes. They could not share that information even if they wanted to due to legal and contractual obligations.</p>
        <p>Privacy laws prevent the sharing of patient information. This is a good thing. We don't want our personal health information to be shared with the world.</p>
        <p>However, <span class="highlight">there is a loophole that we can exploit.</span> My doctor cannot legally share my information without my explicit written consent. However, <span class="highlight">I</span> can share my information with <span class="highlight">whomever I want</span>. I can share my bills with you. I can share my bills with the world... and I will. So can you. So can everyone. We can all share our bills with each other. They don't even have to have our names on them. They just have to say what services were rendered for what conditions and for what price. <span class="highlight">That is all we we all need in order to put anyone in the system who is trying to take advantage of us on blast.</span></p>
        <p>That's what RxRevolt is all about: empowering patients through transparency and community. We want people to be able to anonymously share this information. We believe <span class="highlight">everyone</span> should have access to this information for <span class="highlight">free</span>. We refuse to accept an architecture that would allow for any bias. We refuse to accept any advertising, paywalls, tampering, or exploitation.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to create a <span class="highlight">free, open-source, non-profit, non-commercial, non-partisan, non-biased, non-discriminatory, non-censoring, non-identifying, non-privacy-violating, non-evil</span> platform that will allow for the sharing of this information. We want to create a platform that will allow for the <span class="highlight">comparison</span> of this information. We want to create a platform that will allow for the <span class="highlight">challenge</span> of this information. We want to create a platform that will allow for the <span class="highlight">transparency</span> of this information.</p>
        <p>This project depends on everyone working together and sharing information.</p>
