# Areas of Concern

## Implementation Complexity

1. The project scope includes specialized PoP logic, IPFS integration, PII scrubbing, and a new chain design. Each module (validation queue, IPFS pinner, ledger, governance, etc.) is fairly isolated, which is good for modularity, but also increases the learning curve for newcomers.

2. It can be hard to ensure that each subsystem (especially the PII stripping, IPFS pinning, and PoP consensus) works correctly and remains robust across upgrades.

## Consensus/PoP Security


1. Ephemeral Challenge Model: If the entire chain’s security relies on ephemeral challenges in each block (plus node signatures proving IPFS pinning), malicious actors might exploit predictable or weak randomness. The design does mention VRF-based or block-hash-based approaches, but it remains an open question how truly unpredictable or tamper-resistant this ephemeral challenge is.
2. Data Availability: Relying on IPFS plus PoP means you need to trust that the chunked IPFS data truly remains pinned over time. Attackers might claim to pin but quietly discard seldom-requested chunks. An occasional on-chain Merkle proof might not be enough if the challenge frequency is too low or too predictable.

## Scalability & Storage Overhead

1. This architecture implies storing a large volume of data in IPFS. Even though the chain references only CIDs, maintaining enough nodes that genuinely pin tens or hundreds of gigabytes of healthcare data may stress the network.

2. The chain design does not yet specify how large the bills/EOBs can be, or how many documents might be submitted daily. Without careful chunking or partial replication approaches, node operators might find the data load excessive.

## Governance Complexity

1. A multi-sig + community voting model is proposed for removing bad CIDs. This can be too centralized if the multi-sig is small, or too slow if a large community vote is required for each questionable CID.

2. There is also the mention of a “reputation system” for nodes; it can be quite difficult to implement it fairly, avoid Sybil attacks, and keep the logic transparent.

## Privacy & Compliance

1. The design attempts to ensure PII stripping and naive or advanced methods for removing personal data. This is a major undertaking, especially for real healthcare documents.

2. Even with community moderation, it is possible that some documents might leak partial PII (like a wrong redaction or unrecognized format). The architecture’s “naive regex” or even an optional ML-based scrubbing can fail in edge cases. The chain’s impetus to store everything in IPFS might conflict with “the right to be forgotten” or certain privacy rules.

## Reward & Inflation Model

1. The indefinite inflation approach is valuable for incentivizing new nodes, but might also lead to concerns about long-term token value. If the chain’s token does not hold enough perceived value, or if inflation outstrips demand, it could reduce incentives for honest pinning.

2. Conversely, if block rewards are too high, we get runaway token supply or a potential “pump and dump.”

## Reliance on IPFS

1. IPFS is extremely useful, but can be brittle if not carefully managed—particularly for large, rarely accessed files. If data is pinned mostly by altruistic or reward-seeking nodes but not widely replicated, it might degrade over time.

2. The architecture references daily “WAL merges” pinned as new sqlite snapshots. That’s a large overhead if the chain sees a high throughput of new documents. Snapshots are pinned, but older ones get unpinned after some time. This could lead to historical data being lost if no node volunteers to keep hosting it.

## Additional Attack Surfaces

1. Since users can submit arbitrary compressed documents (bills/EOBs) which then get pinned, there is a potential attack vector if unscrupulous or malicious documents appear. The system’s PII stripper or validator must handle them safely (no malicious ZIP exploits, PDF exploits, etc.).

2. The consensus logic for PoP is fairly new: it’s critical to ensure that cryptographic proofs of storage can’t be cheaply faked or that partial chunk referencing doesn’t let attackers bypass real data pinning.
