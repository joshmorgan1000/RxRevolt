## Disclaimer & Data Privacy Notice

Welcome to **RxRevolt** (the “Project”). By participating in the Project—whether by submitting healthcare cost documents, pinning data to IPFS, or otherwise engaging with the network—**you acknowledge and accept the following legal considerations**.

---

### 1. PII Removal & Potential Re-Identification

1. **Best-Effort PII Scrubbing**  
   Our software is designed to remove or redact **personally identifiable information (PII)** from the healthcare cost documents submitted (e.g., names, addresses, unique IDs). However, **no system is foolproof**. Despite our efforts, **there is always a small risk** that some residual data could identify you, directly or indirectly.

2. **Residual Data Risk**  
   By contributing documents or metadata, **you inherently share** this information with the world through a distributed system. Even with anonymized and redacted text, **re-identification** is possible under certain circumstances (e.g., cross-referencing data from external sources).

3. **Your Responsibility**  
   You are encouraged to take **whatever additional actions you deem necessary** to protect your privacy:
   - Manually black out or obfuscate any personal information before submission.
   - Double-check that all PII is removed to your satisfaction.
   - Refrain from uploading materials that are sensitive beyond your comfort level.

### 2. Consent & Data Sharing

1. **Implicit Consent**  
   By submitting or pinning any data to **RxRevoltChain**, **you agree** to the global, public nature of this blockchain/IPFS-based system. Content in IPFS is replicated across multiple nodes and **cannot be entirely removed** once published.

2. **For the Greater Good**  
   The Project’s mission is to increase **healthcare cost transparency** and empower patients by creating an open, non-commercial repository. While we acknowledge the **privacy risks**, your participation helps build a powerful resource for patient advocacy, academic research, and policy reform.

### 3. No Warranties & Liability Limitations

1. **No Warranty**  
   The software and related services are provided **“AS IS”**, without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not warrant that:
   - The system will identify and remove all PII accurately.
   - Any particular re-identification risk is fully eliminated.
   - The system will meet all specific user needs.

2. **Limitation of Liability**  
   To the fullest extent allowed by law, **neither** the Project maintainers **nor** any contributors shall be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages resulting from:
   - The use or inability to use the software or services.
   - The inadvertent disclosure or re-identification of personal data.
   - Any reliance placed on the data pinned or stored within the Project.

---

### 4. Personal Responsibility & Regulation

1. **Local Laws & Regulations**  
   Participants are responsible for understanding and complying with **all applicable laws** (including health-data or privacy regulations). If you are subject to strict privacy rules (e.g., HIPAA in the United States), **do not** share data that could breach your compliance obligations.

2. **Revocation of Participation**  
   If you become uncomfortable with the possibility of re-identification or data sharing, **you may stop participating**. Note that once data is stored on IPFS or the blockchain, **complete removal** may not be feasible.

### 5. Future Changes

1. **Updates to this Legal Notice**  
   We may revise or update this **LEGAL.md** document to reflect evolving legal concerns or changes in the Project’s scope. Continued use after changes implies acceptance of the revised terms.

2. **Contact**  
   If you have questions or concerns regarding these legal provisions, please reach out to the Project maintainers.
